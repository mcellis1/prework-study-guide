## How to use basic code to build a website

Throughout the prework modules I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a basic, functional website:

- I better understand web development.
- I have a good grasp on the basic functions of HTML, CSS, and Javascript now.
- I am familiar with the GitHub website and how it functions in the web development community.
- I can now operate the basic software used in the coding bootcamp on my computer.

## Installation

First use the HTML to provide the basic structure of the website. Include the Head and Body of the site. The Head is not visible to the outside viewer, but the body is. The Head defines the basic elements used on the site like the language, and the integrations with other lines of code. The body is the actual text that the outside viewer will read when navigating to the site.

After the HTML is in place, use CSS to change the colors and appearance of the website to appear how you want it. You can then use Javascript to add in functions for your website.

## Usage

Use this website to review notes about what was studied in the prework modules. You can use ctrl+shift+I to pull up the inspect window and have random study topics generated for you.
